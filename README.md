# Fungi Taxonomy

An interactive web application for exploring fungal taxonomic hierarchies. This project demonstrates the implementation of biological classification systems through an engaging visual interface, allowing users to navigate through different taxonomic ranks from Kingdom Fungi down to genus level. Features include an expandable tree structure, inheritance visualization, and the ability to add new fungal specimens to the knowledge base.
